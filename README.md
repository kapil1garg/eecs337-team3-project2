## Configuration file
The config.json file is a configuration file that each user must create to access the APIs we used in this project. The file should be located at the root of the project and the format is as follows:
```
{
	"ndb_api_key": YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
}
```
Below is a list of where each needed API key can be obtained.
